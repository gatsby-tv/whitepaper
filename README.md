# Gatsby's Whitepaper

This repository is dedicated to the continual, collaborative document cementing
the official plans, operations, and achievements of GatsbyTV. Our intention is
to use this repository as a hub for discussions and for tracking updates made to
the document itself.

## Compilation

The whitepaper is written using LuaLaTeX which can be installed through [TeX
Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/). The provided `Makefile` uses
[latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html) wherein running `make` will
compile the document as a pdf and `make watch` will allow for automatic
recompilations when any files are written to.
