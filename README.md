# Gatsby's Whitepaper

This repository is dedicated to the continual, collaborative documents cementing
the official plans, operations, and achievements of GatsbyTV. Our intention is
to use this repository as a hub for discussions and for tracking updates made to
the documents themselves.

## Compilation

Both documents are written using LuaLaTeX which can be installed through
[Tex Live](https://www.tug.org./texlive/). The provided Makefile depends
on [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html). To compile the pdf
files, simply run `make`; to see additional commands, use `make help`.
